# GeniusTest

1. Open project in something like Atom
2. Go to dev-test.js
3. Set 'const artist = <Artist you'd like to search for>'
4. Set 'const fileName = <Name of file to be appended to -unique-words.txt' (no spaces)
5. Run the project.

It can't always find the artist-id of the artist you're searching for (for ex. with Thursday).
It's pretty damn slow. I threw this together so it's not organized or optimized or anything like that but it's a proof of concept.
